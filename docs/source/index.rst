Welcome to eesunhong's documentation!
=====================================

Installation
------------

To install ``eesunhong`` use

.. code:: shell

    pip install eesunhong

Although not required, as is generally good practice for any development project, we highly recommend creating a separate virtual environment for each distinct project. For example, via Conda, creating a virtual environment for a project using ``eesunhong`` might look like

.. code::

    conda create -n eesunhong_env python=3.11

Then before working, be sure to activate your environment with

.. code:: shell

    conda activate eesunhong_env

Then install ``eesunhong`` within this environment.
