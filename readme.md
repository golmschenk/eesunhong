# eesunhong

## Installation from precompiled (recommended)
For most common systems, a precompiled binary of `eesunhong` exists. In these cases, only Python 3.8+ is required. To install, use:
```
pip install eesunhong
```
Depending on your Python installation, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

## Installation from source
If you are on a more rare system (e.g., Windows on ARM), a precompiled binary may not exist. In these cases, the above `pip install` command requires some additional dependencies. Specifically, CMake, a Fortran compiler CMake is able to find, and `fypp` must be installed. With these installed, the above `pip install` command will compile and install the package from source code.

## Usage
Once installed, `eesunhong_main` will run the main executable.
